# 🐭 Mice-Sleeper: A Minesweeper Variant

Mice-Sleeper is a Python-based reimagining of the classic Minesweeper game, created as part of MIT's 6.1010 course. This project features both **2D** and **N-dimensional** gameplay, a custom **WSGI server**, and a clean interactive web interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **First-click safety**: mice are dynamically relocated to avoid immediate loss
- 🌐 WSGI-based backend serving game logic and frontend files
- 🧩 **N-dimensional support** for advanced gameplay
- 🖥️ Interactive frontend built with HTML and JavaScript
- 🔁 Custom game state tracking, flood-fill reveal, and flag toggling ("bed" mode)
